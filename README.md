# Map 

A repo for processing maps. Currently not a generic implementation. But contains a implementation to visualize the price pr. m**2 for each postal code in oslo. The data is from my other repo called web scraping.

## To run

Everything is in the jupyter, and when run will save the final figure. 

## requirements/dependencies.

python specific requirements/dependencies listed in requirements.txt

The realestate.csv file from the webscraping repo is also a requirement.
